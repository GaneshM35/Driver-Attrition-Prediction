# Driver Attrition Prediction

## Project Description
Driver Attrition Prediction for Ola

### Overview
This project aims to address the high churn rate among drivers at Ola, a leading ride-hailing service. Frequent driver turnover poses significant challenges, including increased recruitment costs and negative impacts on organizational morale. By leveraging data science techniques, this project seeks to predict driver attrition and provide actionable insights to enhance driver retention strategies.

### Problem Statement
Recruiting and retaining drivers is a critical challenge for Ola. High churn rates among drivers lead to increased recruitment costs and can negatively affect the company's operations and morale. The ability to predict whether a driver is likely to leave the company can help Ola implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing attrition and associated costs.

### Objectives
- **Predict Driver Attrition**: Develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a driver leaving the company based on various attributes.
- **Identify Key Factors**: Analyze and identify the key factors contributing to driver attrition.
- **Provide Insights**: Offer actionable insights and recommendations to improve driver retention strategies.

### Data Description
The dataset includes monthly information for a segment of drivers for the years 2019 and 2020. The attributes provided include:
- **Demographics**: City, age, gender, etc.
- **Tenure Information**: Joining date, last date.
- **Performance Data**: Quarterly rating, monthly business acquired, grade, income.

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data and identify patterns and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Development**: Develop and train various machine learning models to predict driver attrition.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Analyze the model results to identify key factors influencing attrition and provide actionable recommendations.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

### Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model with high accuracy in identifying drivers likely to leave the company.
- Insights into the key factors driving driver attrition.
- Recommendations for targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and improve driver satisfaction.

### Conclusion
By predicting driver attrition and understanding the underlying factors, Ola can implement effective retention strategies, thereby reducing recruitment costs and enhancing overall driver satisfaction and organizational morale. This project aims to provide a data-driven solution to one of the critical challenges faced by the company.
